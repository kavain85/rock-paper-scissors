# rock-paper-scissors

This is the Rock, Paper, Scissors exercise for The Odin Project. It is meant to test my ability to create a simple game from scratch using what I have learned from previous modules, and my ability to problem solve and find the information that I need to make it work.

Began work on adding UI elements, with buttons for each selection, so the user does not have to input at a prompt, and eventually results will output to page elements instead of browser console.

Added:
- Function for getting computer choice
- Button event handlers to play a round upon clicking a button
- Function for playing a round, and output to console (for testing)
- Additional HTML elements for UI (player/computer choices, scoreboard)
- CSS styling to buttons, choices, and scoreboard (in progress)
